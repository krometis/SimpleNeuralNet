A Julia implementation of a simple neural network: setup, forward propagation, back propagation, and training. See the `examples/` directory for example usage.

## Getting Started ##
To get started, clone the repo:

```
  $ git clone git@github.com:krometis/SimpleNeuralNet.git
```

Switch into the directory:

```
  $ cd SimpleNeuralNet
```

Open Julia

```
  julia

```

Activate the directory and instantiate the project:

```
  pkg> activate .
  (SimpleNeuralNet) pkg> instantiate
```

Hit backspace to exit the Pkg REPL and load the package:

```
  julia> using SimpleNeuralNet
```

See the `examples/` directory for example usage.
